The data in this directory may be generated using the script
"data-raw/u_gamma-gen.R". Make sure to run the script with the working
directory set to "fdpbandsdata/". Note that the script can be run in parallel
using the command-line arguments at the top of that file. The file
"data-raw/parameters.txt" contains a list of the parameters we used for that
script.
