Description: This package contains tables of pre-computed quantiles and 
  confidence parameters for the standardized and uniform bands, respectively 
  (see Ebadi et al. (2022) <arxiv:2302.11837)> for more details). One may 
  compute these bands (using package 'bandsfdp') after installing these tables.
